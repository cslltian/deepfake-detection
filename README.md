# deepfake-detection

To summarize, our main contributions in this work are as follows:

We release the first large-scale benchmarking dataset for fake PoI detection, named FakePoI. It contains over ten thousand high-quality PoI videos generated by our proposed deepfake synthesis method and around five hundred PoI real videos collected from all walks of life.

Our deepfake synthesis method can generate an entire PoI head, including pretty challenging hairs. In addition, our method is able to solve the teeth and side blurring problem which usually appears in other related datasets. Most importantly, it can be directly applied to a new target PoI without any further fine-tuning.

We propose a strong baseline method for detecting a fake clip from a long video.
   
Extensive experiment results on the FakePoI dataset demonstrate that the proposed baseline method works satisfactorily and outperforms existing deepfake detection methods significantly.

Since our paper is in the review stage, I only released part of the datasets and code. I sincerely hope that all researchers can understand. After the article is accepted, I will release all datasets and code.
